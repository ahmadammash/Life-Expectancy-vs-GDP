# Life-Expectancy-vs-GDP
This project analyzes the relationship between Life Expectancy and GDP in six different countries at distinct levels of economic development. The intention is to generate insights and come up with conclusions that inform the WHO on whether and how economic growth affects life expectancy. 

The dataset used in this project contains information on the GDP and life expectancy of countries. The following potential steps will be taken to complete the project:

1. Import the dataset and Required Libraries
2. Examine the structure of the dataset
3. Examine the dataset for errors and/ore missing values
4. Understand the dataset
5. Decide on the visualizations used to examine the relationship between GDP and life expectancy at birth. Also, to check how the relationship differs across the sampled countries.
6. Build the visualizations.
7. Write an analysis of the findings and come up with a conclusion which is provided to the WHO.
